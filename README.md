# Touch Type Trainer

### A personal project to help me learn how to touch type.

As oppossed to being stuck with already established programs, I can create something tailored to my wants and needs to help me learn more effectively. At this rate, I'll be profficient by the time I finish coding this. I'll be using this readme to document my usage and expeerience with github.


### Using Github Projects to manage this project

Opened and created a github project for this project. It seems like a useful feature, hopefully I can work on it more and see more of it's benefits. Seems like a very good way to ensure you work on pieces at a time, usually I just work on whatever, constantly bouncing between things.
