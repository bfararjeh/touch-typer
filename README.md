# Touch Type Trainer

### A personal project to help me learn how to touch type.

As oppossed to being stuck with already established programs, I can create something tailored to my wants and needs to help me learn more effectively. At this rate, I'll be profficient by the time I finish coding this. I'll be using this readme to document my usage and expeerience with github.


### Using Github Projects to manage this project

Opened and created a github project for this project. It seems like a useful feature, hopefully I can work on it more and see more of it's benefits. Seems like a very good way to ensure you work on pieces at a time, usually I just work on whatever, constantly bouncing between things.


### Learning Java Swing

I've been making steady work on the GUI as I type this, and learning Swing in the process. The library seems good, and while it's complicated figuring out exactly how to get what you want on the screen, it's consistent. Getting something working once is good enough to have learnt how to do it moving on to the future. Also experiencing challenges figuring out the optimal way to code what I want, as Swing and furthermore Java offers many ways to approach the same problem, so needing to pick the needle in the haystack of libraries is becoming a recurring theme.
